# City-Scroller
## Description
City Scroller is a game developed in Unity where you jump over obstacles and gain points for the length of time you don't run into any.
I made this game while following the [Create with Code](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code?uv=2021.3) course provided by Unity Learn.

City Scroller is hosted through GitHub pages and can be played here: https://ken-ux.github.io/City-Scroller/
